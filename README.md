## Technologies Used/Takeaways

The front-end framework used was React. To manage state, Redux Tookit was utilized. While the state of the application was not too grand, it was still a great learning experience to use Redux Toolkit to manage state as apposed to regular Redux, which requires too much boilerplate, or the React Hooks. Firebase was used to handle user login and Stripe was added to simulate checkout.
